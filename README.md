Quaranine Accomplishments

<a href="https://mlanglois333.github.io/Quarantine-Accomplishments/"> Click here for the deployed application </a>

This application is designed to help the user log and keep track of movies, tv shows, and books
they have watched and read over the course of the pandemic. When a title is searched, the 
title and relevant information will be displayed for the user, who can then decide to add 
it to their list.

This application uses a single HTML page and a single JS file, with most elements being created dynamically. Our css is powered by a modified version of Tailwind. Our back-end is powered by Jquery and uses the following API's to retrieve information:

OMDB - Movie Database
TMDB - Television Database
OpenLibrary- Books Database

The titles are stored in local storage so they will remain saved on the users device unless they would like to remove it.
